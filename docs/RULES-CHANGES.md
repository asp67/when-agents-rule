# Rules changes

A rules change alters what happens in a match: who wins a fight, how fast an economy grows, or what a model is told. Results from before and after such a change are not comparable. The contract fingerprint recorded in every transcript already separates them, because it hashes the simulation sources and the harness. This page says what changed, and why.

Most entries come from the determinism work: making a match replay exactly from its seed and its commands. Each step changes rules on purpose, and the golden traces in `tests/sim/` are re-recorded with it.

Newest first. The build is the `?v=` number on `js/game.js` in `index.html`.

## Build 933: unit spacing moves into the simulation (26 September 2026)

Separation (units of one owner pushing apart) and building clearance (units pushed out of a building's footprint) decide where units stand, and so who reaches whom in a fight. They ran in the renderer, once per drawn frame, which made the display a rules input:

- **Hidden tab:** a hidden tab draws nothing, so its units did not separate or clear buildings at all while the match ran on in the background.
- **Frame rate:** a slow frame separated less. The push was capped at the strength of one 50 ms frame.
- **Pause:** units kept separating during a pause.

They now run in the simulation step, `js/simulation/position-rules.js`, called from `Game.tick` after every sub-step. The code is moved unchanged.

What changes:

- **Separation and clearance** now:
  - freeze with the world on a pause;
  - run in hidden tabs;
  - have the same strength at any frame rate.
- **Sub-steps:** the simulation's sub-steps are at most **50 ms** (were 100 ms), so no step is longer than the push is scaled for.
- **Model discovery:** what each model has discovered (resource nodes, enemy buildings) is sampled after every sub-step instead of once per frame.
  - A hidden tab ticks four times a second, so a unit grazing a node between two ticks used to leave it undiscovered.
  - This changes what models observe.
- **Contract fingerprint:** the renderer leaves the files the fingerprint hashes as rules (`CORE_FILES`). It no longer decides anything, so a visual change no longer splits comparable results.

Measured on the golden traces at 60 fps, where the old and new code differ least:

- **40 v 40 assault:** unchanged in every count.
- **Wonder siege:** a few hit points differ, and the same units die at the same times.
- **Opening economy:** from minute four, stockpiles differ by a few tens of wood or stone.

The larger effect is in hidden tabs, at low frame rates and during pauses. `tests/sim/position-step.test.cjs` covers those cases.

## Build 919: the rule-based AI loses two self-handicaps (26 September 2026)

- **Attack orders:** it re-issued its attack order to the whole army every 2-second think. Each re-issue reset every unit's swing timer, and a measured 10 v 10 lost about a fifth of its damage to this. Units already attacking the target are now left alone.
- **Clock:** it thought on wall time, so it kept thinking through a pause, and its strength depended on the speed setting. It now thinks on simulated time.

The rule-based AI plays stronger. Campaign opponents and the arena's rule-based seats are harder than in earlier builds.
